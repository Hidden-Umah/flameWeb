# 🔥 FlameWeb — The Minimal Web IDE  

🚀 **FlameWeb** is a lightweight, modern, and visually stunning **browser-based IDE** built to make coding simple, fast, and inspiring.  
This project currently focuses on the **landing page** — a futuristic glassmorphic interface that introduces FlameWeb’s vision for the next generation of web development tools.

---

## 📌 Project Overview  

**FlameWeb** is an ongoing project to design and build a **web IDE from scratch**.  
The goal is to merge **aesthetics**, **performance**, and **developer comfort** into a single interface that feels natural to use — whether you’re writing a single HTML file or experimenting with full-stack projects.

The current phase focuses on creating a **beautiful landing page** that visually represents what FlameWeb stands for:  
> “Power. Clarity. Simplicity — in one flame.”

- ✅ Animated navigation menu (hamburger toggle)  
- ⏳ Glowing edge effects and motion blur  
- ⏳ Scattered icon/image showcase (for tools & features)  
- ⏳ Interactive IDE mockup section (HTML, CSS, JS editor preview)  
- ⏳ Firebase or Flask integration for code saving  
- ⏳ Theme customization (Dark / Light / Flame Mode 🔥)
